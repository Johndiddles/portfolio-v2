<h1 align="center">Hi there <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px"> I'm John</h1>
<h2 align="center">A Full Stack Engineer at Evon Medics LLC</h2>

<p>A Full Stack Engineer bubbling with code and coffee, with 4 years of experience under my belt. Building user-friendly web apps is my jam, and I love wielding JavaScript (React, Next.js, Node/Express) like a magic wand. Plus, I'm fluent in the language of the clouds, thanks to AWS services like Amplify, Cognito, Lambda, and DynamoDB</p>
<p>I started my coding journey on the frontend, sculpting pixel-perfect designs with React. But then I discovered the full-stack symphony, and now I relish being involved in every note, from conception to deployment.</p>
<p>When I'm not knee-deep in code, you'll find me tickling the ivories on my guitar or diving into the latest tech trends. I'm always eager to learn and collaborate.</p>

- ðŸŒ± Alongside my daily job, Iâ€™m working to improve my Backend skills while keeping my frontend skills up-to-date. I also spend some of my free time learning Java.
- ðŸ‘¯ I'm looking to collaborate with companies, individuals and agencies on projects to improve users experience on the internet, provide solutions to real life problems and everyday challenges.
